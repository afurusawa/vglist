There have been several similar websites that do this but they're all a clutter, and keeping track of games isn't their main focus sometimes. Features to include are minor social aspects such as adding friends and viewing compatibility between friends based on personal game ratings and games played</p><h1>Security Details</h1><p>To ensure basic security, all passwords have been encrypted using a salted hash for users who didn't sign up using facebook.</p><p>In case this project is unsustainable, the games database will be dumped into a file, and users will be able to download a csv of their personal rating info and other stats.</p><h1>Compatibility algorithm</h1><p>Thinking of a good algorithm has been a challenge. First and foremost, the key factor is matching ratings, which is comparing the rating of both parties and generating a percentage based on closeness</p><p>Also, rating a game well and personally selecting a game as a favorite can be two different things. Favorite games can be compared as well and be taken into account in generating the compatibility rating.</p><p>Other key factors to consider is platform, genre, volume of games played. Not sure how this will be included.</p><h1>About Me</h1><p>just a web developer who wants to create something nice and relevant to his interests</p><h1>Monetization</h1><p>Need donations most likely... via patreon?</p><p>I could create a paid membership program... I don't want to rely on advertisements but maybe that could be a thing too</p><p>I could limit the amount of users to invitation only (like demonoid)</p><h1>Stack, et al.</h1><p>Jade/Pug, SCSS, BEM, Normalize, AngularJS, Grunt, Node/NPM, Mongo</p><script type="text/javascript" src="/js/modernizr.custom.28468.js"></script><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script><script src="/js/app.min.js"></script></body></html>
